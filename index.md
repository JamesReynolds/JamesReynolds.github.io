# Me

There is a bunch of stuff in [About me](/about.html) but the tl;dr; is: Software Developer/Manager that has used a wide range of tech in methodologies from near-complete CI to total madness.

* Likes: unit tests, integration tests, static analysis and continuous integration.
* Dislikes: laborious unautomated procedures, hand-constructed pet servers (especially Solaris ones) and `WINDOWS_SHOUTING_TYPES`.
* Favourite programming language? Python or good C++.
* Least favourite language? Perl or bad C++.
